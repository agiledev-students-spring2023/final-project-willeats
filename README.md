# Description of Project 

Willeats is an online ordering platform that makes ordering easier both for the business owners and customers. For each dish on the menu, users can first see the reviews and write a review after their order. Restaurants can create and modify their menu and reply to the customers’ reviews.

# History of Project

In reality, it is always hard for the customers to visualize the dishes from plain texts on the menu. So every time they order is like making a guess. Besides, during the time with high-volume, customers often find it hard to find a waiter for them to order or pay the check. To address these problems, the restaurant owners must hire more waiters and make the menu longer traditionally. We initialize WillEats to address such problems.

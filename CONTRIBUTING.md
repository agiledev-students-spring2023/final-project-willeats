# Daily standups



* Daily standups would occur on Friday at 5pm online.

* Attendance is required both for standups and collaboration sessions. Absences should be notified at the previous standup.
* Each team member is granted one regular grace per sprint and one urgent grace for the entire semester.
    * Regular grace must be communicated to other team members at least three days in advance.
    * Urgent grace can be requested at any time.
    * a member who made no progress on a task and did not use the grace for two standups or more in a row will be reported to management.


# Coding standards



1. VS code. ESlint(ESmodule, Use Airbnb style guide)
2. Always pull before working and pushing your code.
3. Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
4. Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
5. Commit messages should be descriptive.
6. Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
7. Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
8. Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality (once you learn how to do that).


# The Git workflow

We will follow the Git workflow specified in the GitHub Flow guide, which requires that all commits to the project be made via a pull request. Before the changes can be merged into the main branch, the pull request must undergo tests and receive approval from at least one other team member. 


# Instructions for setting up the local development environment and rules of contributing 



1. Install dependencies by running npm install in the project directory.
2. Create a new branch for your changes.
3. Make changes to the codebase and commit them to your branch.
4. Run relevant tests locally to ensure the changes are working.
5. Push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
6. Open a pull request (PR) on GitHub, comparing your branch to the main branch.
7. Request a code review from at least one other team member.
8. Make any necessary changes based on the feedback received during the code review.
9. Once the PR has been approved, merge it into the main branch.

# Instructions for building and testing the project (update with that information once the project reaches that stage)**

Will be filled once we reach the testing stage.
